# Personal_AI_Trainer

## About

In this project I have built a Personal AI Trainer using OpenCV. Using any three landmarks we can find the angles between them. Depending upon the angle at the moment we can determine how well a person is training. I have considered squat exercise and can count the number of squts a person has completed. 

This image shows the 33 distinct full-body landmarks:

## Output:


Using three landmarks, (p1=23=left_hip,  p2=25=left_knee,  p3=27=left_ankle)
