# Personal_AI_Trainer

## About

In this project I have built an Personal AI Trainer using OpenCV. Using any three landmarks we can find the angles between them. Depending upon the angle at the moment we can determine how well a person is training. I have considered squat exercise and can count the number of squts a person has completed. 

This image shows the 33 distinct full-body landmarks:

## Demo:
Using these three landmarks, (p1=23=left_hip, p2=25=left_knee, p3=27=left_ankle)
